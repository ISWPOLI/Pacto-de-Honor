Nivo Slider is The Most Popular And Easiest to Use Responsive WordPress Slider Plugin.

== Description ==

The Nivo Slider is the worlds most popular jquery image slider plugin, downloaded over **3,000,000** times since it's inception. This
is the "Lite" version of the official [Nivo Slider WordPress plugin](https://themeisle.com/plugins/nivo-slider?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=web&utm_content=description_link&utm_campaign=nivoslider_lite_plugin)
which comes with email support and more features.

The plugin let's you easily create a post slider, an image carousel or a slideshow, right from your dashboard, without settings that you don't need. Can act as a homepage slider as well and it works great with our [WordPress themes](https://themeisle.com/wordpress-themes/free/).
